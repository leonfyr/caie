**Electric Field**

**Electric field strength** at a point is the force per unit charge that would be experienced by any test charge placed at that point. 

$$
E = \frac{F}{q} \quad [NC^{-1}]
$$

**Electric potential difference** is defined as the work done per unit charge while moving the charge between two points in an electric field

$$
\Delta V = \frac{W}{q} = \frac{Eqd}{q} = Ed \quad [V]
$$

Strength of a uniform field between two parallel plates

$$
E = \frac{\Delta V}{\Delta d}
$$

**Potential energy**

**Electric Potential** at a point is equal to the work done per unit charge in bringing unit positive charge from infinity to that point. 

It is the potential energy per charge. 

**Electric potential due to a point charge**

$$
E = \frac{kQ}{r^2}
$$

**Electric force**

Coulomb's Law

$$
F = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0}\frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}
$$

Coulomb's constant: $k = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0}$

Vacuum permitivity: $\epsilon_0$

**Electric field**

$$
E = \frac{F}{q} = \frac{kQ}{r^2}
$$

All charges are on surface; None inside conductor.
