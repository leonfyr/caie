## 1.2 SI units
**Base quantities** are the quantities on the basis of which other quantities are expressed. 

**Derived quantities** are the quantities that are expressed in terms of base quantities. 

A derived quantity has an equation which links to other quantities (e.g. $F=ma$). 

length, mass, time, current, temperature, amount of substance and luminous intensity

SI units: s,m,kg,A,K,mol,cd

T G M k m 
tera giga mega kilo
milli micro nano pico

# Homogeneity of an equation

An equation is **homogeneous** if quantities on BOTH sides of the equation has the same unit. 

A homogeneous equation may not be physically correct, but a physically correct equation will always be homogeneous.

The speed $v$ of a liquid leaving a tube depends on the change in pressure $\Delta P$ and the density $\rho$ of the liquid. The speed is given by the equation

$$
v = k(\frac{\Delta P}{\rho})^n
$$

Where k is a constant that has no units

What is the value of n?

For AS: $g = 9.81ms^{-2}$

# Significant figures

digits considered significant: non-zero digits, zeros who:

appearing anywhere between two non-zero digits

trailing zeros in a number containing a decimal point

digits considered not significant: leading zeros, trailing zeros in a number without a decimal point

# Estimations

atmospheric pressure 1e5

light takes 5e2 s to reach us from the Sun

frequency of uv light: 7.5e14 to 3e16 Hz

life-span of a man: 2e9 s

# Error

Random errors:

- occur in all measurements

- unpredictable

- can be reduced by average

Systematic errors:

- not random but constant

- consistently underestimate or overestimate a reading

- can be eliminated

Zero Error

Parallax Error

**

**Precision** is the degree of exactness to which a measurement can be reproduced. 

- affected by random error

- improve: repeat and average

**Accuracy** describes how well the result agrees with an accepted value. 

- affected by systematic error

- improve: technique, accurate instrument








# Uncertainty

Three main types of uncertainty:

- Random Uncertainties

- Systematic Errors

- Reading Uncertainties

**The Limit of Reading** of a measurement is equal to the smallest graduation of the scale of an instrument. 

**The Degree of Uncertainty** of a reading (end reading) is equal to half the smallest graduation of the scale of an instrument. 

Absolute / fractional errors and percentage errors

1 mm - 1/208 - 0.48%

random uncertainties = max-min/num :: always 1 s.f.

percentage uncertainty :: 1 / 2 s.f.

## Calculation

Absolute Uncertainty

$y = b \pm c \Rightarrow \Delta y = \Delta b + \Delta c$

Percentage Uncertainty

$
\left. 
\begin{aligned}
&y=b\cdot c \\
&y = \frac{b}{c}
\end{aligned}
\right\}
\Rightarrow
\frac{\Delta y}{y} = \frac{\Delta b}{b} + \frac{\Delta c}{c}
$

$y = a^n \Rightarrow \frac{\Delta y}{y} = n \cdot \frac{\Delta a}{a}$

When the value times a constant, the absolute uncertainty changes but the percentage uncertainty doesn't. 

As the s.f. of the absolute uncertainty is always one, the s.f. of the value can therefore be determined.
