# Uncertainty

Three main types of uncertainty:

- Random Uncertainties

- Systematic Errors

- Reading Uncertainties

**The Limit of Reading** of a meausrement is equal to the smallest graduation of the scale of an instument. 

**The Degree of Uncertainty** of a reading (end reading) is equal to half the sallest graduation of the scale of an instrument. 

Absolute / fractional errors and percentage errors

1 mm - 1/208 - 0.48%

random uncertainties = max-min/num :: always 1 s.f.

percentage uncertainty :: 1 / 2 s.f.

## Calculation

Absolute Uncertainty

$y = b \pm c \Rightarrow \Delta y = \Delta b + \Delta c$

Percentage Uncertainty

$
\left. 
\begin{aligned}
&y=b\cdot c \\
&y = \frac{b}{c}
\end{aligned}
\right\}
\Rightarrow
\frac{\Delta y}{y} = \frac{\Delta b}{b} + \frac{\Delta c}{c}
$

$y = a^n \Rightarrow \frac{\Delta y}{y} = n \cdot \frac{\Delta a}{a}$

When the value times a constant, the absolute uncertainty changes but the percentage uncertainty doesn't. 

As the s.f. of the absolute uncertainty is always one, the s.f. of the value can therefore be determinded.
